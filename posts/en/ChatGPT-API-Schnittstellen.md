ChatGPT API is an advanced technology that allows you to create human-machine interactions. One way to use this technology is to develop your own interface in the form of e.g. input masks together with the ChatGPT API. In this article, we consider the functionality and importance of creating custom input masks in relation to the ChatGPT API using two examples: car kit configuration and app development cost estimation.

Setting up a car can be a daunting task when you consider many factors such as color, engine, finish, etc. However, instead of developing an algorithm to automate this task, developers can create their own custom input forms to allow users to select and save the configurations they need. These input masks can then be combined with the ChatGPT API to generate suitable recommendations based on the selected criteria. For example, an input form could allow users to select the color and finish they want, and ChatGPT could then suggest engines, wheels, and other options that match the selected profile.

Another example of using a custom input mask along with the ChatGPT API is for app development cost estimation. Application development can be very expensive and costs can vary widely based on features and functionality. However, instead of developing an algorithm that automatically calculates these costs, developers can create their own input forms that allow users to select and save the desired app features. These input forms can then be combined with the ChatGPT API to calculate development costs based on selected features and functions. For example, an input form can allow the user to select desired features such as login, payment processing, and database connections, and ChatGPT can then calculate a development cost estimate based on that.

The main advantage of using custom input masks together with the ChatGPT API is that developers can save themselves the trouble of developing algorithms for these tasks. Instead of writing an algorithm that automatically calculates a car's configuration or development costs, developers can create their own input masks that allow users to select the parameters they need. This makes creating such applications easier and faster.

However, it should be noted that ChatGPT is never deterministic and is not necessarily correct. Although ChatGPT is capable of supporting human-like communication, there is no guarantee that ChatGPT's assumptions or estimates are always correct. ChatGPT may provide inaccurate or incorrect information which may lead to incorrect results. Because of this, developers should always exercise caution when using ChatGPT and ensure that the recommendations and ratings generated by ChatGPT are reviewed and rated before being integrated into the application.

Despite these limitations, there are many advantages to using custom input masks in conjunction with the ChatGPT API. By creating custom input masks, developers can simplify and speed up application development without having to develop complex algorithms. Using ChatGPT also allows for the integration of human interaction with applications, which increases the applications' usability and usability. In business, using a custom input mask along with the ChatGPT API can also be economically beneficial. By automating tasks like vehicle tuning or estimating development costs, companies can save time and resources, which can lead to increased efficiency and productivity. Integrating ChatGPT into applications can also help increase customer satisfaction and sales by providing users with a better user experience.
